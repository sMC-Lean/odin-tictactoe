# odin-tictactoe

project for the TOP assignment, build a game in plain JS using factory functions and a rough MVC architecture.

the spec is to separate the data and behaviour from the DOM elements as much as possible, and to only update the UI as changes are made.
calls for the use of factory functions and write code in way that only exposes the necessary elements and reduces access where it is not required, IE with the use if IIFEs.
all game logic should be able to run in the console first, is not briefed to work with a architecture but to sepearate functions within a single JS file.
asks us to create a UI that will allow users to play the game in the browser and reset the game.
